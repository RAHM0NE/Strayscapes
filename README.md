# Strayscapes

**Mapping stray lives across urban space**

---

## Overview

Strayscapes is a community-driven platform that visualizes and maps the lives of stray animals‚Äîprimarily cats and foxes‚Äîacross urban environments. By collecting sightings and stories, Strayscapes aims to foster a deeper understanding of how these animals interact with our cities and how urban planning can impact their lives.
